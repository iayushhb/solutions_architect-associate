# Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)

![Alt text](/Photos/ec2-logo.png)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.

> Like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of your own data center.

- *Pay only for what you use*
- *Select the capacity right now, grow and shrink when you need*

## EC2 Pricing Options 
### On Demand Instances - 
1. Low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 withoud any upfront payment or long-term commitment.
2. Used for Application with short-term , spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
3. Used for Applications that are being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

### Reserved Instances - 
1. Used for Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
2. Used for Applications that require reserved capacity.
3. You can make upfront payments to reduce the total computing costs even further.
4. With Standard-RIs you can upto save 72% off the on demand price.
5. With Convertable RIs you can save upto 54% off the on demand price. which have the option to change to a different RI type of equal or greater value.
6. With scheduled RI you can launch within the time window you define. Match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day , week or month.

****Reserved Instances Operate at regional level***

#### Savings Plan with Reserved Instances - 
1. Save up to 72% : All AWS compute usage, regardless of instance type or Region.
2. Commit to 1 or 3 Years : Commit to use a specific amount of compute power (measured by the hour) for a 1-year or 3-year period.
3. Super Flexible : Not only EC2, this also includes serverless.

## Spot Instances - 
A Spot Instance is an instance that uses spare EC2 capacity that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price. The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and is adjusted gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available.

## Dedicated Hosts - 
1. **Compliance** : Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
2. **Licensing** : Great for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
3. **On-Demand** : Can be purchased on-demand (hourly).
4. **Reserved** : Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.
