# Creating a user ^_^

> Firstly head over to IAM > Users then hit create user and you'll get this page.

Now choose any name you'd like to use for user and hit next.

Now you can choose any route but I'm just gonna choose `Attach Policy Directly` and giving it *administrator access*. 

> Attaching Policy Directly is not reccommended because it can get pretty hectic to manage each user individually.

After that you are offered to add Tags(Tags are key-value pairs you can add to AWS resources to help identify, organize, or search for resources) which are optional.

Then just hit **create** and your user is created successfully.
